         I'm Devyanee Dalmia- a dynamic and driven individual pursuing an interdisciplinary major in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship at Ashoka University, with a passion for technology, social impact, and innovation. I bring a unique blend of technical proficiency, creative strategy, and grassroots leadership to every initiative I undertake.

        Beyond my studies, I'm developing my skills as an incoming Teaching Assistant for the course "Branding and Communication" for the Lodha Genius Program and gaining industry experience as a Marketing Intern at Burda Luxury. At Ashoka, I'm actively involved, leading social media and community outreach for Rotaract and the Ministry of Technology, events for the Computer Science Society and Women in Computing Science, contributing to the Ashoka Tech Consulting Group, and securing funding for a startup at Startup Ashoka 2024.

        My experience also extends to conducting research on Internet Protocol Design at UC Santa Cruz and driving impactful campaigns and programs, including photography workshops for trafficking survivors.

      <p>
        Whether it's developing digital solutions, crafting marketing strategies, or organizing STEAM education initiatives, I thrive on building solutions that are both impactful and inclusive.
